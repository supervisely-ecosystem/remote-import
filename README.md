## Overview

Connect your remote data storage to Supervisely Platform without data duplication.   

**NOTE #1:** most frequest usecase is when Enterprise Customer would like to connect huge existing data storage (tens of terabytes) and avoid data duplication. In other cases we recommend to use general import procedure to store data in Supervisely Data Storage.  

**NOTE #2:** this release works only with data structured in Supervisely format. In future versions raw images, videos, and other formats will be added. 

If you have ideas or suggestions, please post an idea in üí°[Supervisely Ideas Exchange](https://ideas.supervise.ly/).

2. Run NGINX to to serve static files (images and annotation) by executing the following command: 

`docker run -p 8088:80 -v $(pwd):/mnt/data jetbrainsinfra/nginx-file-listing:0.2`

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO: explain how to deploy it in isolated environment for Enterprise Instances

## How to use

1. Put address to the remote directory with project in Supervisely format (where `meta.json` is). And press `Preview remote`.

2. List of all files and directories will be shown. Every directory is dataset (because this release supports only supervisely format) with two folders `img` and `ann`. Select what datasets will be uploaded.

3.

- avoid using special characters in name, replace spaces with `_` or `-`
- existing datasets will be skipped. 
- app will be stopped automatically at the end
- app stops on error
- import images will be added later
